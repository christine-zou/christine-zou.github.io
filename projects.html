              <b>Abstract &mdash; </b>This research study aims to redesign soccer cleats for female soccer players to reduce the likelihood of anterior cruciate ligament 
              (ACL) tears. Females are up to eight times more likely to tear their ACL in comparison to males, and soccer cleats are mainly designed for men with women's 
              cleats lacking comfort and performance. We propose an alternative design by varying the density of the outsole to relieve pressure off the knee. Our design 
              redistributes the forces on the foot to achieve an optimal valgus and knee flexion angle, putting female soccer players less at risk, thus reducing the forces 
              that lead to ACL injuries. Seven different outsole density patterns were designed based on the Nike Premier FG 3 and then printed with Ultimakers out of 
              thermoplastic polyurethane using support blockers in Cura. Each pattern was tested on five athletic young adult females. The knee flexion and valgus angles 
              were measured using a virtual reality tracking system as the subjects performed actions of walking, running, and jumping.</p>
