              <b>Abstract &mdash; </b>This research study aims to redesign soccer cleats for female soccer players to reduce the likelihood of anterior cruciate ligament 
              (ACL) tears. Females are up to eight times more likely to tear their ACL in comparison to males, and soccer cleats are mainly designed for men with women's 
              cleats lacking comfort and performance. We propose an alternative design by varying the density of the outsole to relieve pressure off the knee. Our design 
              redistributes the forces on the foot to achieve an optimal valgus and knee flexion angle, putting female soccer players less at risk, thus reducing the forces 
              that lead to ACL injuries. Seven different outsole density patterns were designed based on the Nike Premier FG 3 and then printed with Ultimakers out of 
              thermoplastic polyurethane using support blockers in Cura. Each pattern was tested on five athletic young adult females. The knee flexion and valgus angles 
              were measured using a virtual reality tracking system as the subjects performed actions of walking, running, and jumping.</p>

              The final CAD assembly model is shown on the right. We each modeled and fabricated different parts utilizing the lathe and CNC mill in the machine shop and 3D printing. Below on the left is a link I machined and assembled with a gear. 
              Next to it is our final button pressing mechanism that was 3D printed with an additional acrylic piece glued on for the bonus green button. The wiring I setup and tested &mdash; admittedly organization and cleanliness was
              not a priority as we ended up having bigger issues.

            <p>During our initial testing, I identified that the transmission ratio was too low, casuing our belt to slip under load. 
              Our system lacked sufficient torque to overcome the mechanical resistance so we first tried to increase the tension in the belt as shown in the images below. However, the tension required for stable, reliable operation
              was still greater than what this configuration could maintain.</p>

                <p>As my teammates explored different approaches to maintain sufficient belt tension over the following days, I focused on developing and refining
                  the Arduino control code so we could transition smoothly into testing once the system was ready. Yet, by the night before our final demonstration, the 
                  assembly remained nonfunctional. Determined to resolve the issue, I combed through the lab's spare components and found a compatible gear with the same tooth profile but a smaller diameter to increase our transmission ratio. 
                  After carefully modifying it by drilling out the press-fit pin (shown on the right), we replaced the original driving gear, allowing for full motion to the linkage and achieving reliable performance just in time. </p>
